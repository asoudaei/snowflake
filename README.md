Data Pipeline Project
This project uses dbt, Airflow, and Snowflake to transform and manage data:

dbt: Handles data transformations, creating clean, analysis-ready datasets.
Airflow: Schedules and orchestrates dbt jobs in a seamless pipeline.
Snowflake: Stores raw and transformed data for analytics.
This pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage, readying data for reporting and analysis.
